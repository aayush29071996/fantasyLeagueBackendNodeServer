    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">The limelight season has arrived. The part where football world catches it breath, the matchups that distinguish good players from the grandiose, average from geniuses, class players from world class players is now here. Yes, the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals are right on cue. The first leg of these matches start on April 11/12 followed by the second leg on April 18/19 respectively. But this time, all the four fixtures are mouthwatering clashes featuring teams involving contrasting playing styles like Monaco vs Borussia Dortmund and Atletico de Madrid vs Leicester City.</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">Even though all the clashes seem like a treat to a neutral, the two most awaited clashes of the season are Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich and Juventus against Barcelona. One is a repeat of the 2014 semifinals (where Real cruised past them 5 nil on aggregate), while the other is a repeat of the 2016 final which Barcelona won 3-1 to lift their 5 th European Cup. This time, much has changed in these teams, especially at Bayern and Real Madrid. One would be lying if they said they expected the same result out of these fixtures this time around.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">First, let’s see what the first match has got us in store. Real Madrid aren’t the same frighteningly fluent and attacking team they once were the last time these stalwarts met in 2014. Real Madrid have now become a team that gradually grind out results every now and then. It doesn’t mean they don’t attack as before, it just means now they know when to attack and when to collectively defend as a unit. And of course, when everything seems lost for them, there is that man Sergio Ramos to pop up with most important goals late in the match just as that guy in every class who doesn’t care what the syllabus is but clears the exam with utmost ease and makes his mates jealous. Cristiano Ronaldo seems to have realized his waning ability and adjusted his game to help out his teammates more and Zidane is reaping the rewards for that. Casemiro is a huge factor in this fixture as he will be the one marking Thiago and going horn to horn with Arturo Vidal in that midfield battle.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">Bayern on the other had now do not pass for fun, but attack with intent for fun. Guardiola’s style seemed to take away what made this Bayern a powerhouse 3 years ago, the lightning quick counterattack and transition from defense to attack which is coincidentally the USP of all Ancelotti’s teams. They are virtually going to face a team which does the same – Zidane’s Real Madrid. Thiago Alcantara has been lighting up the Allianz Arena with unparalleled performances along with Lewandowski who has made the modern CF position his own with abundance of goals. Thomas Mueller, even though he hasn’t scored as many he does, is a big game player and is bound to turn up in full flight against Real Madrid.</p>
