    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">The Juventus – Barcelona game is like a game of chess between two contrasting teams who have their own set of notions about winning. Juventus is a team that has historically been known to win ties solely on their defensive prowess. Especially Max Allegri seems to be master tactician when it comes to knockout two legged ties. Though they have lost Pirlo, Pogba and Vidal, their midfield with Marchisio, Khedira and Pjanic still looks indomitable and all three seem to be in fine form for both their club and country. In addition to them are Dybala, Higuaín and Mandzukic who can’t stop scoring goals. But it is their defense of Barzagli, Chiellini and Bonucci who neither seem to get tired or lose focus even when playing 50 matches per season. They defend, defend, and defend and know when to pass through the lines when the opposition midfield goes sleeping. This might pose a major headache for Luis Enrique and his midfield.</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">Barcelona have been rejuvenated since the historic comeback against PSG and the team is also under less pressure since their manager’s announcement to leave at the end of the season. This has given them a new spring in the stead and their attack seems to be gelling together again. But it is their backline which seems to have become shaky conceding goals out of nowhere. Neymar has been their standout player this season, with Messi and Suarez chipping in with important goals. They haven’t lost a match with Umtiti, so he may as well start the quarterfinals with Pique provided he isn’t injured.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">This Juventus – Barcelona tie is like when an unstoppable force meets an indestructible wall.</p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;text-indent: 4%;">May the better force win.</p>
